Key Takeaways:
This exercise allows me to learn how use MongoDB as our main database server.

Code Desciption:
This would involve integrating a Node.js application with MongoDB, a NoSQL database. It includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, connecting to MongoDB, defining schemas/models using Mongoose (a Node.js ORM for MongoDB), and querying the database.
